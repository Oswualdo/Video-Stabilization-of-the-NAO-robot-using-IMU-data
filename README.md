# Video-Stabilization-of-the-NAO-robot-using-IMU-data
The implementation of a video stabilization system of the NAO robot is presented through the data of the IMU, this stabilized image is used to detect and tracked QR codes. Once the QR code is located, the NAO robot tracks and monitors it. The system was developed under the ROS platform implementation of modules in C++ and Python language. The system provides data for subsequent processes, which need to use video data for object recognition, task tracking, among others. Can get sequences of stable images and with the least amount of vibrations or sudden movements. One of the main benefits of this work is the visual tracking of objects through stable images during walking of the NAO robot, which introduces an erratic motion of the head camera, the effect that is mitigated with the digital visual gyrostabilized method presented in this work.
